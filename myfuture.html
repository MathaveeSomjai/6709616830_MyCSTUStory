            <img src="./resoures/pgm.jpg" alt="check resoures pgm.jpg">
            <p> n the future, I dream of being a programmer who can work from home. I want to have plenty of time to rest and manage my
            work schedule without the need to commute to an office. Working in a comfortable environment at home would boost my
            creativity and productivity. I aim to become a skilled programmer while maintaining a healthy balance between work and
            personal life, finding happiness in both.</p>

                getting isekai in another world wouldn't be so badâ€”whether as a slime, a magician, or even a pirate king."</marquee>
